  ## Project description:
  ### 
  P!CK0 is an online food ordering/delivering app, allowing customers and drivers to freely choose their orders based on possible order choices. Without very low tipped order being sent to the driver.

There will be three interfaces. Users can register themselves to three different roles, such as Customer, Driver, Store Owners. Customers will be users that order foods, Drivers will be users that deliver food to the Customers, and Store Owners will be users that provide the food for customers to order. When users login, it will redirect users to their corresponding interface.

Client’s interface. Shown available restaurants in the area, customers will be redirected to restaurant order menus (HTML) where they click and choose their orders. Then redirected to payment site (HTML). Then this order will appear in the driver's interface for drivers to pick.

When the Store Owner registers, the request will be sent to the admin. Once the admin receives the request, the admin will ask for menus and set up a html order page for the owner.
Owners interfaces. Owner will be able to confirm the order and will be able to select if their item is OOS or not.

Drivers’ interfaces. When a user registers for a driver position, the user will be sent to the administration for verification. Verification will be implemented once the app is ready to release to public. Drivers will see all available orders for delivery, They can pick any order to delivery.

The position verification for user login will be verified through database record. 

Since this app is under development we can ignore the verification step for now, once it’s ready for publication we will implement verification features for restaurant owners and drivers in the future.
